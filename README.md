# Corrosion Rule of Thumb
The rule of thumb proposed in NACE TPC 5 is used to valuate the corrosive severity of the produced fluid in oil & gas wells. 
It states the following:
* High risk of corrosion for CO2 partial pressures greater than 30 psi.
* Medium risk of corrosion for CO2 partial pressures less than 30 psi but greater than 7 psi.
* Low risk of corrosion for CO2 partial pressures less than 7 psi.

The partial pressure of CO2 is calculated as follows:

$$\text{Partial Pressure CO}_2 = \left(\frac{\text{\% Molar of CO}_2 \times \text{Pressure at Packer Depth}}{100}\right)$$
