# Corrosion Rule of Thumb
## Severity of the corrosive environment (CO2)
The rule of thumb proposed in NACE TPC 5 is used to valuate the corrosive severity of the produced fluid in oil & gas wells. 
It states the following:
* High risk of corrosion for CO2 partial pressures greater than 30 psi.
* Medium risk of corrosion for CO2 partial pressures less than 30 psi but greater than 7 psi.
* Low risk of corrosion for CO2 partial pressures less than 7 psi.

The partial pressure of CO2 is calculated as follows:

$$\text{Partial Pressure CO}_2 = \left(\frac{\text{molar percentage of CO}_2 \times \text{Pressure at Packer Depth}}{100}\right)$$

## Severity of the acidic environment (H2S)
In low carbon steels and alloys, stress cracking can occur due to the presence of sulfides. This phenomenon occurs when the partial pressure of H2S exceeds certain limits.
For carbon steels, the NACE MR 0175-88 standard establishes a limit value for the partial pressure of H2S of 0.05 psi. That is, at partial pressures greater than the mentioned one, the steel will degrade.
For martensitic stainless steels (e.g., L80 Cr13), this limit depends on the in-situ pH. For pH values lower than 3.5, the partial pressure limit of H2S is the same as that of carbon steel (0.05 psi). For values ​​higher than 3.5, the limit increases. The following graph shows the acceptable limits for a 13Cr steel:

The selection of the type of stainless steel should take into account the percentage of sodium chloride and the temperature. The following graph shows the application ranges for each of them:
